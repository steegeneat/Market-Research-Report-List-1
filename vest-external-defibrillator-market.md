<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vest External Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li> Fully Automatic</li><li>Semi Automatic </li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vest External Defibrillator market is categorized into two main types: fully automatic and semi-automatic devices. Fully automatic defibrillators analyze the patient's heart rhythm and deliver a shock without any user intervention, making them suitable for laypersons in emergency situations. In contrast, semi-automatic defibrillators require the user to manually initiate the shock after rhythm analysis, providing an added layer of control for trained responders. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing cardiac arrest survival rates through timely defibrillation.</p></p>
