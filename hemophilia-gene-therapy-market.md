<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemophilia Gene Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemophilia A</li><li>Hemophilia B</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hemophilia gene therapy market is primarily segmented into two categories: Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B. Hemophilia A, caused by a deficiency in factor VIII, represents the larger segment due to its higher prevalence. Gene therapies for Hemophilia A focus on delivering functional copies of the factor VIII gene to patients’ cells. Hemophilia B, resulting from a deficiency in factor IX, has a smaller market but is growing with innovative therapies aiming to provide long-term solutions. Both segments are advancing rapidly due to ongoing research and clinical trials.</p></p>
