<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ctDNA Detection Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Detection</li><li>Joint Detection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ctDNA detection market is categorized into two main types: independent detection and joint detection. Independent detection involves analyzing circulating tumor DNA solely to identify genetic mutations associated with cancer, providing specific insights into tumor characteristics. In contrast, joint detection combines ctDNA analysis with other diagnostic methods, such as tissue biopsies or imaging studies, enhancing overall diagnostic accuracy and treatment monitoring. Both approaches aim to improve cancer management by enabling earlier detection and better tailoring of therapies to individual patients.</p></p>
