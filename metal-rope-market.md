<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Rope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Insulated Metal Rope</li><li>Non-Insulated Metal Rope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal rope market is primarily divided into two types: insulated metal ropes and non-insulated metal ropes. Insulated metal ropes are designed with a protective layer, enhancing safety and preventing electrical conductivity, making them suitable for applications in electrical installations and environments with high electrical risks. Non-insulated metal ropes, on the other hand, lack this protective covering, offering greater flexibility and strength, and are commonly used in construction, rigging, and heavy lifting applications where electrical insulation is not a concern.</p></p>
